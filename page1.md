## **Chapter Title: Deep Learning Methods in the Analysis of Neurological Disorders**

### **Introduction**

Deep learning-based generative models—such as diffusion models, neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs), and reinforcement learning (RL)—are offering new possibilities for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating neurological disorders. However, one of the most pressing limitations in this field lies in the restricted number of available medical imaging datasets. Clinical datasets often contain only a few thousand samples, limiting the generalizability of models and hindering their application in real-world clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, synthetic data generation has emerged as a highly promising avenue. By using diffusion models, realistic brain images can be generated to diversify and expand existing datasets, leading to improvements in model performance.

In this chapter, we present a systematic review of the use of diffusion models, Neural ODEs, and reinforcement learning in addressing major neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We examine key publications from the last five years, highlighting methodological innovations, application domains, and performance benchmarks.

### **Diffusion Models and Neurological Disorders**

Diffusion models have garnered substantial attention in the domain of brain image synthesis and data augmentation, particularly due to their ability to generate high-resolution, realistic 3D images.

#### **Brain MRI Synthesis and Data Augmentation**

One of the most comprehensive studies in this domain is by Pinaya et al. (2022), who trained a latent diffusion model on approximately 32,000 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs from the UK Biobank. The model generated over 100,000 synthetic MRIs conditioned on variables such as age, sex, and structural volume. The synthesized data achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 0.0076, indicating a high degree of similarity to real images and outperforming conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors have released this large synthetic dataset for public use, making it a valuable resource for the broader research community.

Another important contribution was made by Peng et al. (2023), who proposed a 2D conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRI reconstruction. Their approach focuses on synthesizing a sub-volume of a brain scan by conditioning on adjacent slices. This methodology is particularly advantageous in terms of memory efficiency, as it allows high-quality 3D image reconstruction without requiring extensive GPU resources.

#### **Anomaly Detection and Inpainting**

Pinaya et al. (2022) also explored the use of denoising diffusion models trained on normative (i.e., healthy) brain MRIs to detect pathological anomalies. Using 15,000 FLAIR images from healthy individuals in the UK Biobank, their model achieved high performance in identifying abnormalities such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), multiple sclerosis lesions (from the MSLUB dataset), and brain tumors (from the BRATS dataset). The model’s Dice similarity scores were competitive with single Transformer models and only slightly lower than ensemble-based approaches.

The same group applied a similar diffusion-based approach to 2D CT images of intracranial hemorrhages, achieving rapid and accurate anomaly segmentation. This speed, combined with diagnostic accuracy, suggests that such models may be suitable for clinical deployment in emergency settings.

#### **Longitudinal Completion of Missing MRI Data**

In longitudinal studies of disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, complete temporal MRI datasets are often unavailable due to subject dropout or technical issues. To address this, Chen et al. (2023) proposed a 3D diffusion-based model named “ReMiND” that imputes missing MRI volumes by conditioning on available prior (and optionally future) scans. Evaluated on the ADNI dataset, ReMiND outperformed forward-filling and variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methods in both imputation error and prediction of brain atrophy patterns, especially in the hippocampus.

#### **EEG Signal Modeling and Generation**

Diffusion models have also been applied to electrophysiological data such as EEG signals. Wang et al. (2023) implemented a classifier-guided conditional diffusion framework to generate realistic EEG data for Alzheimer's disease detection. The generated samples were conditioned on both patient identity and session/class labels, helping address class imbalance and data scarcity.

Jiang et al. (2024) developed a model named EEG-DIF, which forecasts the future behavior of multi-channel epileptic EEG signals. The model demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 89%, making it a potential candidate for early seizure warning systems.

Wang et al. (2024) further introduced a spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion network, STAD, designed to reconstruct high-density (256-channel) EEG data from low-density (64-channel) input. This model significantly improved downstream classification accuracy and neural source localization.
